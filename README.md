EXIF Cataloger is a project made with Python and Google Map Geolocation API. The program loads all photos from the given folder, and then if the photo has location tags (EXIF), it determines the place where the photo is taken using the Google Map API. All photos are copied to the new folder with the changed name, including the name of the country and city from which the photo is taken. The program requires its own generated API key and the billing function to be enabled.The project was also generated to the .exe version using the cx_Freeze library.
